# Markdown to pdf

Small utility designed to convert your markdown files to pdf. 

## Installation

In order to install the dependencies required for the tool, just install YARN first: `npm install -g yarn`.
Afterwards, just run `yarn` in the root folder and it'll fetch all the dependencies.

## Usage

Just create a new folder called `data` under the root of the project and add a file called `README.md`. Running `npm start`
will yield a folder output, containing the resulting PDF.

Run `yarn run start` to convert the file from data into the file `./readme.pdf`
